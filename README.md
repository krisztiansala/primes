# Application with prime numbers
This is a small exercise to calculate prime numbers up until a given number and memorize the results to be able to be used in later calculations.

It is visualized using a React app created with Vite and deployed with Github Pages.

Also, there is a JavaScript file called that can be run from the command line with `node script.js <number>`. This will store the primes to a json file and read it in repeated calls.
